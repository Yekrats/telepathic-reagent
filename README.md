ClojureScript implementation of Carl Klutzke's "Telepathic" https://AreYouTelepathic.com

## Overview

This is an attempt to develop the card game "Telepathic" in a ClojureScript environment.
Though the game is still in development, most of the game is implemented through hot-seat play.

## Development

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein fig:build

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

	lein clean

To create a production build run:

	lein clean
	lein fig:min
